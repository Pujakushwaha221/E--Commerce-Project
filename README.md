**Project Title: E-Commerce 360: Data-Driven Strategy & Operations Optimization**

**📌 Project Overview**
In this project, I acted as a Data Analyst for a dynamic e-commerce platform. The goal was to transform raw transactional data into actionable insights across four critical business pillars: Customer Intelligence, Product Performance, Sales Growth, and Inventory Efficiency.
By analyzing relationships between customers, orders, and products, I developed a framework to help Marketing, Supply Chain, and Sales teams make data-backed decisions.

**🛠️ Tech Stack & Skills**\
**SQL:** Complex Joins, CTEs, Window Functions (for trend analysis and segmentation).\
**Business Intelligence:** Market Segmentation, Inventory Turnover, and Trend Forecasting.

**🏗️ Data Schema**\
The analysis was performed on a relational database consisting of four core tables:\
Customers: Demographic and location data.\
Products: Catalog pricing and categorization.\
Orders: Transactional headers (Total amount, dates).\
OrderDetails: Granular line-item data (Quantities and per-unit pricing).

**📊 Key Analysis Areas & Insights
**

**I. Customer Intelligence & Market Reach**\
**Geographic Hotspots:** Our primary customer clusters are concentrated in Delhi, Chennai, and Jaipur.\
    Strategy: Allocate 60% of the localized ad spend to these regions to capitalize on existing brand awareness.\
**Engagement Paradox:** Analysis shows an inverse relationship between order frequency and customer count. The majority of revenue is currently driven by occasional shoppers rather than a loyalist base.\
    Strategy: Implement a "Second-Purchase" discount funnel or a loyalty program to convert one-time shoppers into recurring revenue streams.\
**Category Dominance:** The Electronics category maintains the highest unique customer reach.\
    Strategy: Use Electronics as a "hook" category for cross-selling related accessories (cables, cases) from higher-margin categories.

**II. Product & Inventory Performance**\
**Premium Product Identification:** Product_ID 1 has been identified as a "High-Value Hero." Despite an average purchase quantity of only 2 units, it contributes disproportionately to total revenue.\
     Strategy: Shield this product from aggressive discounting; focus on "Premium/Luxury" positioning in marketing materials.\
**High-Velocity Inventory:** Product_ID 7 exhibits the highest turnover/refresh rate in the catalog.\
    Strategy: Establish "Always-on" restocking protocols for this SKU to prevent stockouts and lost sales.

**III. Sales Dynamics & Seasonality**\
**Revenue Volatility:** A significant 74% sales decline was recorded in February 2024, following a period of stagnation between March and August 2023.\
    Strategy: Investigate external factors (competitor activity or seasonal shifts) for the February downward trend. Plan "Pre-Spring" sales to bridge this gap in the future.\
**Peak Period Resource Planning:** September and December 2023 were identified as peak sales windows.\
    Strategy: These windows require a 30% increase in seasonal staffing and aggressive inventory buffering at least 4 weeks in advance.\
**AOV Shifts:** December 2023 saw the most dramatic fluctuation in Average Order Value (AOV), likely due to holiday bundling.
    Strategy: Analyze the specific bundles sold in Dec '23 to replicate that "basket-building" success during other holiday cycles.

**IV. Marketing Effectiveness**\
**Acquisition Delay:** There is a clear downward trend in new customer acquisition from August 2023 through February 2024.\
    Critical Insight: Current marketing campaigns are seeing diminishing returns.\
**Action:** Conduct a "Channel Audit" to identify which platforms (Social, Search, Email) are underperforming and pivot the budget toward top-performing cities (Delhi/Chennai/Jaipur).
